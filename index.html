							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								<strong>BINCAT - BINary CATalog for AO Sytems Performace Evaluation</strong><br>
								<span style="font-weight:600; font-style:italic;">Principal Investigator, INAF Fundamental Astrophysics Call 2024</span><br>
								<span style="font-weight:500; font-style:italic; font-size:9;">miniGrant Awardee</span><br>
								Awarded funding for the development of a catalog of close binary stars (50â€“200 mas) as a tool for commissioning
								and optimizing adaptive optics (AO) systems on large telescopes. The project utilizes GAIA DR3 data to statistically
								identify multiplicity indicators and optimize the parameter space through PSF simulations. The catalog will support
								both current and next-generation AO instruments (e.g., MAVIS, MORFEO, ANDES).
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								<strong>Optical Qualification of the Test Tower for the ELT's M4 Adaptive Mirror</strong><br>
								The activities Include simulations, software development for interfacing and advanced control of the optical system 
								and the M4 mirror itself, optical samplings in a large optical testing facility and data analysis. At the time of writing, 
								the measurement of the M4 prototype (DP: Demonstration Prototype, 2x111 actuators) is ongoing, waiting for the M4 unit deployment (spring 2025).

								<strong>Dynamics of Globular Clusters: The Effective Potential Through the Gaia Data Release 3</strong><br>
								Master's thesis	research focusing on internal dynamics of globular clusters, by reducing and analyzing data retrieved from the GAIA Data Release 3. 
								After obtaining a 6-D phase space sample of the stars, kinetical analyses were carried out to extract the <i>"Gravitational Effective 
								Potential"</i>, an additional term to the single-star Hamiltonian that takes into account the dynamical gravitational friction between 
								globular clusters and the host galaxy.<br>

								<strong>Simulation of a point-like and an extended source of SZ signal and filtering optimization for MUSTANG2</strong><br>
								6 months research activity carried out during my Master's degree, in which, together with prof. Elia Battistelli as PI, we investigated the cosmic web through the study of the ICM 
								(IntraCluster Medium) between colliding galaxy clusters Abel399 and Abel401. The observation of an extended 
								Suniaev-Zel'dovich source was was simulated, recreating the Green Bank Telescope's 90GHz instrument MuSTANG2. Based on real noise 
								data, synthetic data was created and added to the obtained simulated maps, and a filtering optimization analysis was carried out.<br>

								<strong>Juno Data Analysis Workshop for Science Capacity Building</strong><br>
								Workshop held by NASA and ASI in which I had the opportunity to work, together with Juno-NASA's expert scientists and engineers, 
								with Jupiter's data from the latest spacecraft's close-orbits of the giant planet. In particular, my team's project focused on 
								Jupyter's rings	through the Stellar Reference Unit (SRU) instrument, particularly in measuring the intensity of the reflected light in function of viewing angle.<br>
